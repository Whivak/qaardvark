# hello!

i am qaardvark, a human in paraíba that really likes web browsers and like to play with weird html and css stuff.

my name is not qaardvark.

## about me:

i use librewolf, my signal is private, but i am very active on reddit and on discord: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/qaardvark) / [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/966110743315509299)

i have a lot of weird sites, including this weird one about some mythical creatures that i created called alkafaterys: [alkafaterys](https://qaardvark.github.io/alkafaterys/).

i like web browsers so much that i am currently making a browser encyclopedia, it was originally a private collection, but now it is an encyclopedia.

i despise what i define "death tech", which is just a compilation of fraud companies like alphabet, meta, microsoft, amazon, apple etc, and i think privacy in any place including online should be a human right, not a privilege. <br><sup>*i know it sounds cliché but its true*</sup>

but paradoxically i use windows but i am slowly moving towards endeavor os, i use it mostly because of compatibility.
