# hello!

i am qaardvark, a human in para√≠ba that really likes web browsers and like to play with weird html and css stuff.

my name is not qaardvark.

## about me:

i use librewolf, my signal is private, but i am very active on reddit and on discord: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/qaardvark) / [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/966110743315509299)

i have a lot of weird sites, including this weird one about some mythical creatures that i created called alkafaterys: [alkafaterys](https://qaardvark.github.io/alkafaterys/).

i like web browsers so much that i am currently making a browser encyclopedia, it was originally a private collection, but now it is an encyclopedia.

i really hate google, microsoft, meta and apple, and i think privacy in any place including online should be a human right, not a privilege.

but paradoxically i use windows but i am slowly moving towards endeavor os, i use it mostly because of compatibility.
