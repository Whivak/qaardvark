# hello!

i am qaardvark, a human in para√≠ba that really likes web browsers and like to play with weird html and css stuff.

my name is not qaardvark.

## about me:

i use librewolf and brave, i am currently slowly moving towards librewolf to stop google monopolizing browser engines, as i am in brazil, i unfortunately have no power of decision regarding using whatsapp and instagram, because everybody here uses it and if i do not, i won't be able to talk with anyone i know irl, because literally everyone with a cellphone here, has whatsapp and the majority of times, refuse to change to signal :(, i have signal, but its useless as nobody uses it...

my instagram, signal and whatsapp are private, (i do not post anything) but i am very active on reddit and on discord: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/qaardvark) / [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/966110743315509299)

i have a lot of weird sites, including this weird one about some mythical creatures that i created called alkafaterys: [alkafaterys](https://qaardvark.github.io/alkafaterys/).

i might do a small homepage for myself sometime, but not a portfolio, just to store my sites i guess? or to write some things about me? idk...

i like web browsers so much that i am currently making a browser encyclopedia, it was originally a private collection, but now it is an encyclopedia.

i really hate google, microsoft, meta and apple, and i think privacy in any place including online should be a human right, not a privilege.

but paradoxically i use windows but i am slowly moving towards zorin os, i use it mostly because of compatibility.
