# hello!

i am qaardvark, a human in para√≠ba that really likes web browsers and like to play with weird html and css stuff.

my name is not qaardvark.

## about me:

i use librewolf and brave, i am currently slowly moving towards librewolf to stop google monopolizing browser engines, as i am in brazil, i unfortanetly have no power of decision regarding using whatsapp and instagram, because everybody here uses it and if i do not, _apparently_ nobody in the world will know me.

my instagram and whatsapp are private, (i do not post anything) but i am very active in reddit and on discord: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/qaardvark) / [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/966110743315509299)

i have a lot of weird sites including this weird one about some mythical creatures that i created called alkafaterys... [alkafaterys](https://qaardvark.github.io/alkafaterys/)

i like web browsers so much that i am currently making a browser encyclopedia, it was originally a collection but now its an encyclopedia.

i really hate google, microsoft, meta and apple, i use windows but i am slowly moving towards zorin, i use it mostly because of compatibility.
